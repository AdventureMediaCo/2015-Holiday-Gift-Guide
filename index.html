                    <p>The Rolla Roaster is one of those "why didn't I think of that?" products. Instead of using the errant stick you found. These beautifully made roasters come in numerous colors, have a telescoping fork so they pack down small yet extend out when you need it, and lastly allow you to rotate whatever you are roasting so it cooks nice and even.</p>
                    <p><a href="http://www.dasmule.com/arb-d-shackle-10-472-lbs/"><u>ARB D Ring Shackle $13.95</u></a></p>
                    <p>I have a hard time thinking I could have too many shackles. Whether they are hanging from your bumper, hooking a tree saver around a tree, or oddly disappearing into your buddies tool bag, it always helps to have a few more. These shackles are rated at 10,640 lbs and are the perfect stocking stuffer.</p>
                    <p><b>Under 50 Dollars </b></p>

                    <p>Airing down and airing up ones tires is an essential part of traveling off road.

When it comes time to refill your tires this Inflator hooks up inline with a compressor and gives you a read out as you fill up.</p>

                    <p>As you now know Airing down your tires is a critical part of off highway travel. Even though the process is relativity easy, there is always room for improvement. The ARB E-Z deflator pulls the valve core out of your tire gets air out FAST. All while giving you a reading of what your pressure is. Gone are the days of shoving your key into your valve stem hoping for the best. This is quick and painless. Paired with the above inflator this makes airing down and up a breeze.</p>
                    <p><a href="http://www.dasmule.com/products/jak-jaw.html"><u>JAKJAW Hi-Lift Jack Adapter $41.95</u></a></p>
                    <p>If you have used the ubiquitous Hi-Lift jack you know that it can sometimes get a little hairy. The JakJaw takes everything that is great about the Hi-Lift and makes it even better. Increasing the size of your lifting point and making it into a claw shape practically locks your Hi-Lift to what you are lifting. Bumpers, or rock sliders become easy to use lift points with the JakJaw.</p>
